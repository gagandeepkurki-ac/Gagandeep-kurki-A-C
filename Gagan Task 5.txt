Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark
Objective: Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.
Tools Used: Wireshark (Free, Open Source)
Method (Steps Taken):
 . Installed Wireshark and launched the tool.
2.	Selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi).
3.	Started capturing live packets.
4.	Generated traffic by browsing a website (HTTP/HTTPS) and running ping to google.com.
5.	Stopped the capture after approximately 1 minute.
6.	Applied protocol filters (DNS, TCP, ICMP).
7.	Identified and analyzed at least 3 protocols.
8.	Saved the capture file as .pcap.
Findings:
Protocol	Description	Example Packet Detail
 DNS	Resolves domain names into IP  	uested 'google.com' —+ DNS server respond 
	TCP	Pro 	des reliable communication (connectior€j	3-way handshake: SYN SYN-ACK 
ICMP	Used for network diagnostics like ping Pi 	request (Echo) and response (Reply) recor 
d with IF ACK  ed
 
Outcome: Gained hands-on experience in capturing and analyzing network traffic, identified common protocols (DNS, TCP, ICMP), and learned filtering techniques.
